Seems that people like to make backwards-incompatible changes to the sauer info protocol.

Thomas in his PSl servers has some funny protocol which sends data some in an "alternating" fashion for player info requests.
It looks like: (\i:-3\i{8})+\s?\s\i{13}
Each message sent includes a copy of the previous one with new information. Weird. There are <cn> of those sent.

Another problem: seems that the extinfo version has not been bumped up. There are some older servers sending incompatible stuff.

hopmod works just fine, nicely backwards compatible.

The Thomas/Wahn mods seem weird as fuck :-D and undocumented. Naughty, naughty!

Also Coop mode on a certain contains 9 more ints. Not sure what they are being used for.
I guess they just are putting stuff at the end as opposed to anything else. Which is fine. Meaning I had to add some extra code to handle those rogue servers.
